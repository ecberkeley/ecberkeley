  Two important points.
  	1.) The above code has been released with open source licenses.
  	    The code in http://www2.thu.edu.tw/~wenwei has been released with a GNU General Public License,
  	      otherwise known as the GPL.
  	    The Beanshell code is dual licensed (you may pick one) under the "Sun Public License" or the
  	    "Gnu Lesser Public License" (LGPL).
  	    
  	    These kinds of licenses mean you may download, use, modify, extend, and distribute the software,
  	    as long as you don't charge for the implementation, and give notice of the original distributions,
  	    sometimes also providing the full original distribution.
  	    
  	    There are many kinds of open source licenses and Creative Commons licenses.
  	    
  	    Discuss advantages.
  	    
    2.) The availability of these packages means you don't have to write this code.
        Thus, it is faster and better to spend the time learning what someone else did, 
        than to re-invent.  This fits well with CDC.  It also means that there is more
        code re-use, which makes codebases stronger, more flexible, and more secure. 
        Critical to this is that when you find bugs, or implement extensions, that you 
        share them back to the creators of the software, and to the world.  It is a level 
        of responsibility, but also of opportunity to learn and network.

 echo -n "CP=.:" > setclasspath.sh
 for jar in ../lib/* ; do  echo -n  "$jar:"; done >> setclasspath.sh
