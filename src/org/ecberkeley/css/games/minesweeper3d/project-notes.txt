Moved all source to svn repo here: 
      ~/src/ecberkeley/src/org/ecberkeley/css/games
   but source also needs to be developed in 
      /Users/laramie/doc.lar/projects/charlie/tapes/dynamide/build/ROOT/homes/dynamide/assemblies/com-dynamide-apps-1/apps/tagonomy/resources/static/minesweeper3d/
   so that we can run under a real web server.
   
To update, go here:
    ~/src/ecberkeley/src/org/ecberkeley/css/games
and do 
    ./pull.bash
    svn update minesweeper3d/
    svn commit minesweeper3d/
    
To pack a zip of source, without ant, just do: 
   cd  ~/src/ecberkeley/src/org/ecberkeley/css/games/minesweeper3d
   rm minesweeper3d.zip; find . |grep -v '.svn' | zip minesweeper3d.zip -@
   
   All of this is done in 
       ~/src/ecberkeley/src/org/ecberkeley/css/games/pull.bash
